Access Control Lists (ACL) Extension
====================================

[![PGXN version](https://badge.fury.io/pg/acl.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/pg/acl) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arkhipov/acl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arkhipov/acl) [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/arkhipov/acl?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/arkhipov/acl)

Quick Start
===========

Why do I need this?
-------------------

You need this extension if you want to restrict access to rows in tables based
on an authenticated user.  Access Control List (ACL) has become the de-facto
standard for implementing a security model in modern applications.  Complex
scenarios can be handled by using ACLs without having a complex permission
model at the application level.

This document is not intended to be a tutorial on ACLs and security and
describes the Access Control List Extension only. You can find more information
on ACLs on the sites below.

  1. [Wikipedia: Access Control List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
  2. [MSDN: How AccessCheck Works](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa446683%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
  3. [MSDN: ACL Technology Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229742%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)
  3. [Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt)
  4. [POSIX Access Control Lists on Linux](http://users.suse.com/~agruen/acl/linux-acls/online/)

The extension provides you with a number of special types representing ACL
entries (ACEs) and a set of functions that check a user against an ACL.

But wait! There is already the `aclitem` type. What is wrong with it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The `aclitem` is an internal type.  Its behaviour may change in a future
release without notice, so do not rely on it unless you like living
dangerously.  Besides, in a typical mid-tier/server environment, applications
rarely have separate database accounts for each user, which means that the
`aclitem` type will do little to help you secure your application.

How do I set it up?
-------------------

If you are running Linux, the easiest way to install the extension is to to use
the [PGXN client](http://pgxnclient.projects.pgfoundry.org/).

    $ pgxn install acl

Or if you prefer to stick with the good old Make, you can set up the extension
like this:

    $ make
    $ make install
    $ make installcheck

If you are running Windows, you need to run the [MSBuild](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159)
command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f35ctcxw.aspx).

    > msbuild /p:pgversion=9.4 /p:configuration=Release /p:platform=x64

The platforms available are x64 and x86 and the configuration are 9.1, 9.2,
9.3, 9.4, and 9.5.

Or you can download the latest released zip [here](https://github.com/arkhipov/acl/releases/latest).

Then you must copy the DLL from the project into the PostgreSQL's `lib`
directory and the `.sql` and `.control` files into the directory
`share\extension`.

    > copy x64\9.4\acl.dll "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\lib"
    > copy *.control "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\share\extension"
    > copy *.sql "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\share\extension"

Once the extension is installed, you can add it to a database.

    $ CREATE EXTENSION acl;

How can I create an ACL?
------------------------

Since an ACL is a simple one-dimensional PostgreSQL array, the easiest way to
create it is from a literal constant.

```SQL
SELECT '{a/i/postgres=rwd, d//user=r, a//=r}'::ace[];
```

ACL can have zero or more access control entries (ACE).  Every ACE has the
following textual representation.

    [type]/[flags]/[who]=[mask]

There are two types of ACEs: allow and deny (`a` and `d` in a textual
representation).  The `type` part is mandatory.

The `who` part defines for which role this ACE is in effect.  There is a
special identifier `""` (empty string) representing everyone.

Mask is a string value that specifies the permissions that are allowed or
denied in an ACE.

For more information on ACLs see ACL Structure section below.

How can I compute an ACL based on a parent ACL?
-----------------------------------------------

ACLs are often applied to hierarchical structures.  In order to compute a new
ACL based on a parent ACL, use the following function.

  * `acl_merge(ace[] parent_acl, ace[] acl, bool container, bool deny_first)`

The `container` parameter determines if the ACL is computing for a container
object or a leaf object.

The `deny_first` parameter defines if the deny ACEs must be placed first (this
is a default behaviour for all Microsoft products).

For more information on ACL flags see ACL Structure section below.

How can I check if the user has the permission to access the data?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you created an ACL, you may want to determine if it grants a current or
any particular user a specified set of permissions.  In order to do this, use
one of the following functions.

  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, text mask, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, int4 mask, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, text mask, oid role, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, int4 mask, oid role, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, text mask, name role, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace[] acl, int4 mask, name role, bool implicit_allow)`

The first two check the PostgreSQL current user against the specified ACL while
the four others take the role to check in its third parameters.

There are two types of `acl_check_` functions which take `text` or `int4` as
the mask.  Production environments should **always** use the latter form as it
is much more efficient.

The functions return the granted permissions (either as a `text` or `int4`,
depending on the type of their mask parameters).  If no permissions are granted,
an empty string is returned.

There is also an additional parameter `implicit_allow` which controls whether
permission is granted if it was not explicitly granted or denied in the ACL.

I need custom permissions. Is it possible?
------------------------------------------

There are 16 custom flags and 16 custom permission (see ACE Structure section
below).  How you use them is up to you.  All the extension functions ignore
custom flags.

Does this work with PostgreSQL 9.5 row-level security?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes!  The Access Control List Extension integrates flawlessly with PostgreSQL
row-level security.  All you need is to add an ACL column to your data table
and define security policies.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE file_system (id int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, parent_id int, is_directory bool NOT NULL, name text, acl ace[]);

ALTER TABLE file_system ADD CONSTRAINT file_system_parent_fk FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES file_system(id);

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON file_system TO PUBLIC;

ALTER TABLE file_system ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY file_system_read_policy ON file_system FOR SELECT TO PUBLIC
USING (acl_check_access(acl, 'r', false) = 'r');

CREATE POLICY file_system_update_policy ON file_system FOR UPDATE TO PUBLIC
USING (acl_check_access(acl, 'w', false) = 'w');

CREATE POLICY file_system_delete_policy ON file_system FOR DELETE TO PUBLIC
USING (acl_check_access(acl, 'd', false) = 'd');

CREATE POLICY file_system_insert_policy ON file_system FOR INSERT TO PUBLIC
WITH CHECK (acl_check_access((SELECT p.acl FROM file_system p WHERE p.id = file_system.parent_id), 'w', false) = 'w');

CREATE FUNCTION file_system_modify()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  v_parent_acl ace[];
BEGIN
  v_parent_acl = (SELECT p.acl FROM file_system p WHERE p.id = NEW.parent_id);
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    IF NEW.parent_id IS NULL THEN
      -- Only a superuser can add a root directory
      IF current_user <> 'postgres' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Access denied';
      END IF;

      RETURN NEW;
    END IF;
  END IF;

  IF v_parent_acl IS NULL THEN
    NEW.acl = NULL;
  ELSIF NEW.acl IS NULL THEN
    NEW.acl = v_parent_acl;
  ELSE
    NEW.acl = acl_merge(v_parent_acl, NEW.acl, NEW.is_directory, true);
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER file_system_insert.
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON file_system
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE file_system_modify();

INSERT INTO file_system(id, parent_id, name, is_directory, acl)
VALUES (1, NULL, '/', TRUE, '{a/c/=r}'),
       (2, 1, '/home', TRUE, '{a//=rdw}'),
       (3, 1, '/bin', TRUE, '{a//postgres=rdw,d//=rdw}');

SELECT * FROM file_system;
```

```
 id | parent_id | is_directory | name  |                acl
----+-----------+--------------+-------+-----------------------------------
  1 |           | t            | /     | {a/c/=r}
  2 |         1 | t            | /home | {a//=dwr,a/hc/=r}
  3 |         1 | t            | /bin  | {d//=dwr,a//postgres=dwr,a/hc/=r}
```

Then connect as another user and check how it works.

```SQL
SET ROLE test;

SELECT * FROM file_system;
```

```
 id | parent_id | is_directory | name  |        acl
----+-----------+--------------+-------+-------------------
  1 |           | t            | /     | {a/c/=r}
  2 |         1 | t            | /home | {a//=dwr,a/hc/=r}
```

```SQL
INSERT INTO file_system (id, parent_id, name, is_directory, acl)
VALUES(10, 1, '/test', TRUE, '{a//=rdw}');
```

    ERROR:  new row violates row level security policy for "file_system"

```SQL
INSERT INTO file_system (id, parent_id, name, is_directory, acl)
VALUES(10, 2, '/home/test', TRUE, '{a//=rdw}');

SELECT * FROM file_system;
```

```
 id | parent_id | is_directory |    name    |        acl
----+-----------+--------------+------------+-------------------
  1 |           | t            | /          | {a/c/=r}
  2 |         1 | t            | /home      | {a//=dwr,a/hc/=r}
 10 |         2 | t            | /home/test | {a//=dwr,a/hc/=r}
```

```SQL
DELETE FROM file_system WHERE id = 1;
```

    DELETE 0

```SQL
DELETE FROM file_system WHERE id = 10;

SELECT * FROM file_system;
```

```
 id | parent_id | is_directory | name  |        acl
----+-----------+--------------+-------+-------------------
  1 |           | t            | /     | {a/c/=r}
  2 |         1 | t            | /home | {a//=dwr,a/hc/=r}
```

What if my application does not rely on the PostgreSQL roles system?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can still use the Access Control List Extension even if your application
does not rely on the PostgreSQL roles system.  There are three additional ACE
types supported.

  1. `ace_int4` (e.g. `a/h/1985=rdw`, `d//-2015=s`)
  2. `ace_int8` (e.g. `a/h/0=w`, `d/oic/1234567890=AB`)
  3. `ace_uuid` (e.g. `a//00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB=r`)

And a set of `acl_check_` functions that are slightly different from the ones
you have seen so far.

  * `acl_check_access(ace_int4[] acl, text mask, int4[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace_int4[] acl, int4 mask, int4[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace_int8[] acl, text mask, int8[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace_int8[] acl, int4 mask, int8[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace_uuid[] acl, text mask, uuid[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`
  * `acl_check_access(ace_uuid[] acl, int4 mask, uuid[] roles, bool implicit_allow)`

The third parameter of these functions is an array of roles that your
application considers the user has.

How does it impact performance?
-------------------------------

It introduces some overhead in the data reading, depending on the type and
size of the ACLs (see Performance Benchmarks below), averaging 25%.  It is way
faster than any existing mid-tier security solution could offer.

I no longer see role names in ACEs! What happened?
--------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you will see a number sign (#) followed by a number instead of a role
name.

    d/h/#42=w

Or an entry with a special 'x' (INVALID) flag.

    a/ox/=rd

It happens when the OID specified in the ACL entry cannot be resolved to a role
name.  One of the most likely causes is that the role was deleted.  Since ACLs
are usually set on a large number of objects, it would be unwise to try to
remove invalid entries every time a role is being removed from the system, so
these invalid ACEs remain there until you remove them manually.  Another
imporant reason that makes us provide a reasonable textual representation of
every ACE is that PostgreSQL uses them to make backups and restores.

Are there any tutorials on how to use the extension and ACLs in an application?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, no, but feel free to write one :)

Building the extension
======================

To build it, just do this:

    $ make
    $ make install
    $ make installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    "Makefile", line 8: Need an operator

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as gmake:

    $ gmake
    $ gmake install
    $ gmake installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    make: pg_config: Command not found

Be sure that you have pg_config installed and in your path.  If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
-devel package is also installed.  If necessary tell the build process where to
find it:

    $ env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make install && make installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    ERROR: must be owner of database regression

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

    $ make installcheck PGUSER=postgres

Once the extension is installed, you can add it to a database.  Connect to a
database as a super user and do this:

    $ CREATE EXTENSION acl;

ACE structure
=============

ACE textual representation
--------------------------

    [type]/[flags]/[who]=[mask]

Examples

  * `a/ihpc/acl_test1=wd`
  * `d/ox/acl_test1=s`
  * `a//"acl test2"=dw0`
  * `a//"test""blah"=AB1`
  * `d//=`
